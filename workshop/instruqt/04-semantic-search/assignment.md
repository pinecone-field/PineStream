# 🧠 &nbsp; Understanding Hybrid Search
===

You already implemented semantic search using dense embeddings in the previous challenge by searching for vectors similar to the centroid. In this challenge, you will go further and implement a hybrid search combining the dense and sparse results.

In a nutshell, the hybrid search process consists of the following steps:
- performing a dense vector search (semantic similarity)
- performing a sparse vector search (lexical similarity)
- combining the results and deduplicating them
- reranking the results

# 🕵️ &nbsp; Check the Current Implementation
===

Go to the [Terminal](tab-1) and start the application (if not already running):

```run
cd /app/webapp
pnpm dev
```

Go to the [PineStream tab](tab-2) and try using the semantic search functionality (✨ icon in the search bar). You can use any example queries it provides or write your own. Notice that it does not return any results. That's because the semantic search functionality has not been implemented yet.

**You will now implement it**!

# 🚀 &nbsp; Implementing Vector Search
===

The PineStream's semantic search API is implemented in the `server/api/search/semantic.ts` file. Open it in the [IDE tab](tab-0) and find the `doVectorSearch` function.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is a single function because Pinecone's API for vector search is independent of the index type (dense/sparse). When you send a query targeting a given Pinecone index, it knows the index type and uses the appropriate vector search method.

Notice that the function has several arguments: the search text, the limit, the metadata filter, and **the index name**. The endpoint calls this function twice—once for the dense index and once for the sparse index.

To implement the search request, paste the following code in the body of the placeholder:

```ts
// Build the search options for Pinecone
const searchOptions: any = {
  query: {
    inputs: { text: searchText },
    topK: limit,
  },
};

// Add the metadata filter if it exists
if (Object.keys(metadataFilter).length > 0) {
  searchOptions.filter = metadataFilter;
}

// Perform the vector search
const pc = await getPineconeClient();
const index = pc.index(indexName);
const results = await index.searchRecords(searchOptions);

// Extract movie IDs from the results
results.result.hits.forEach((hit) => {
  const movieId = (hit as any).fields?.movie_id;
  if (movieId) {
    movieIds.add(movieId);
  }
});
```

That's it! The function now returns the movie IDs that match the search query.

# 🚀 &nbsp; Implement reranking
===

After calling the above function twice, the endpoint has two lists of movie IDs that match the search query. It deduplicates them but does not know which results are more relevant to the query. While both dense and sparse results have similarity scores, the two types are not directly comparable (scores have different meanings). Thus, the endpoint needs to call a function to rerank the results.

In the same file, find the `getHighestRankedMovies`. Notice how it receives the movie IDs, the search text, and the limit. You will now implement it so it returns the top `limit` movies that are most relevant to the search query. Paste the following code in the body of the placeholder:

```ts
// Fetch movie plots from database for reranking
const movieIdsArray = Array.from(movieIds);
const movies = movieService.getMoviesByIds(movieIdsArray);

// Prepare the texts to rerank
const texts = movies.map((movie) => {
  // Use plot if available, otherwise fallback to overview
  const text = movie.plot || movie.overview || movie.title || "";
  return {
    id: String(movie.id), // Convert to string for reranker
    text: text,
  };
});

// Rerank movies using Pinecone reranker
const pc = await getPineconeClient();
const rerankResults = await pc.inference.rerank(
  "bge-reranker-v2-m3", // which model to use
  searchText, // what user asked
  texts, // the objects to rerank
  {
    topN: limit,
    rankFields: ["text"], // the field to rank by
    returnDocuments: true, // whether to return the documents
  }
);

// The reranker returns results sorted by score (highest first)
// We can directly map the results to our movies and add scores
highestRankedMovies = rerankResults.data
  .map((doc) => {
    const movieId = doc.document?.id;
    const movie = movies.find((m) => String(m.id) === movieId);

    if (movie) {
      return {
        ...movie,
        similarityScore: doc.score || 0,
      };
    }
    return null;
  })
  .filter(Boolean); // Remove any null entries
```

Note the `pc.inference.rerank` call. You are calling a reranking service provided by Pinecone, telling it to use the `bge-reranker-v2-m3` model to rerank the results. For more information on the reranker, see [the Pinecone documentation](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/rerank-results#standalone-reranking).

In a nutshell, your reranking implementation:
1. **Fetches movie data** from the database for the search results
2. **Prepares text content** for reranking (plot, overview, or title)
3. **Uses Pinecone's reranker** to score and reorder results
4. **Maps results back** to movie objects with similarity scores

# ✅ &nbsp; Test Your Implementation
===

Go to the [PineStream tab](tab-2) and try using the semantic search functionality again (✨ icon in the search bar). You can use any example queries it provides or write your own. It should return the top 20 most relevant movies to the query.
